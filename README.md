# FORM
## This is a form webpage that collect user input and display it in a modal box on the webpage.

- Security wise this is not a good practice because it show's user sensitive information on the webpage, but I did it just to use  as a placeholder and beccause its just a project.
### The form uses JavaScript ~ .value ~ to get the user input.
